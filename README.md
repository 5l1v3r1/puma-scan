# Description
Puma Scan is a .NET software security code analzyer. Puma Scan provides real time, continuous source code analysis as development teams write code. In Visual Studio, vulnerabilities are immediately displayed in the development environment as spell check and compiler warnings, preventing security bugs from entering your applications. Puma Scan also integrates into the build to provide security analysis at compile time.
